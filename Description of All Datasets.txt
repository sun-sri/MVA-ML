DATASET DESCRIPTIONS:-

[Dataset 1] 
Bank Marketing 
Refer – https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing

The dataset consists of data gathered from a bank marketing survey. It has 21 variables and 45211 rows. Feature variables considered in the exercises are 'age', 'balance', 'day', 'duration', 'campaign', 'pdays', 'previous'. The target (independent variable) is ‘Has the client in the training dataset, subscribed to a term deposit?’ with binary answers ('yes’, ‘no').


[Dataset 2]
Breast Cancer - Gene Prognostic Signature
Refer:- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE7390

A Survival analysis study was conducted on 198 breast cancer patients to predict distant metastases (dm). Distant metastasis (dm) refers to cancer that has spread from the original (primary) tumor to distant organs/lymph nodes. The study included 76-gene prognostic signatures in lymph node-negative (N-) breast cancer patients. 


[Dataset 3]
ChickWeight	R Documentation

The ChickWeight data frame has 578 rows and 4 columns from an experiment on the effect of diet on early growth of chicks.The body weights of the chicks were measured at birth and every second day thereafter until day 20. They were also measured on day 21. There were four groups on chicks on different protein diets.

weight: a numeric vector giving the body weight of the chick (gm).
Time: a numeric vector giving the number of days since birth when the measurement was made.
Diet: a factor with levels 1, ..., 4 indicating which experimental diet the chick received.
Chick: {not used in the tutorials} an ordered factor with levels 18 < ... < 48 giving a unique identifier for the chick. The ordering of the levels groups chicks on the same diet together and orders them according to their final weight (lightest to heaviest) within diet.

German Breast Cancer Study Group 2 (GBSC2)
Refer – https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/jco.1994.12.10.2086

A dataset with having 686 samples and 8 features. The endpoint is recurrence free survival, which occurred for 299 patients (43.6%). This dataset is the part of a study by the German Breast Cancer Study Group (GBSG) in 1984. This was a randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of different drugs dosage, on recurrence-free and overall survival
